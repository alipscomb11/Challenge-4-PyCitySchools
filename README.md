# Challenge-4-PyCitySchools


1.	Title:  Module 4-Pandas Challenge

2.	Description:  The Pandas code included in this report is based on the assessment and manipulation of Pandas DataFrames that analyzes school and standardized test data.  The final code for this challenge is located in a folder called PyCitySchools.  Some of the key areas that will be analyzed are as follows:

    a.	District Summary
    i.	Total number of unique schools
    ii.	Total students
    iii.Total budget
    iv.	% passing math
     v.	% passing reading
    vi.	% overall passing

b.	School Summary
     i.	School name
    ii.	School type
   iii. Total students
    iv.	Total school budget
     v.	Average reading score
    vi.	% passing math
   vii. % passing reading
  viii. % overall passing

c.	Highest Performing School

d.	Lowest Performing School

4.	Usage

a)	Both PyCitySchools will have a PycityShools_Starter file, Resources, and Challenge 4-File file. 

b)	In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the PyCitySchools requirements are as follows:
    i.	Import pandas as pd from the pathlib import path
   ii.	Read the pandas file
  iii.	Perform the calculations/iterations needed to achieve the output requirement
   iv.	Produce the final output

5.	Dependencies
a.	Importing and reading the correct pandas are critical to enable code execution.

b.	The correct use of strings, variables, and conditions were also very important with this Challenge and the ability to obtain the correct output.

6.	Known Issues: Issues with the script.
a.	On a number of occasions, I received a  ‘file is not defined’ error, which I learned was due to not defining the correct path.
